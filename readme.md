# What is a Pyrosphere?

A Pyrosphere is a 23ft Geodesic sphere with 91 torches affixed to outside of the sphere, at the vertices. The purpose is for an interactive, night-time visual art installation at NEXUS at Burning Man. 

# How does it work?

The Software side of Pyrosphere in 2013 is composed of 3 components:
- Pyroduino. A microcontroller script that reads patterns and signals from the server and communicates to the 91 shift registers. 
- Pyronode. A server that handles client requests and communicates
- Pyromote. A client-side web-application that allows for human interaction with the sphere. 

All of the patterns for the Pyrosphere are contained within the /Pyromotions folder.
